# Toggle Monospace Prompt
Enable the ability to switch between monospaced and proportional fonts in the prompt area.  
Switching will be achieved by adding or removing a custom StyleElement, without modifying the existing StyleElement.


## Usage
You can switch by pressing the button (displayed as `ðŸ‡²` or `ðŸ‡µ`) that will be added to the tool window.  
Pressing M will switch to a monospaced font, and pressing P will switch to a proportional font.
